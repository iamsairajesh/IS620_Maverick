# IS 620 group project
This repository contains the documentation of our IS620 group project.

# Overview:
The project involves creating a new online marketplace to compete with industry giants like Amazon and Walmart. The team's task is to develop software utilizing an Oracle database, implementing operations such as adding products, managing customer information, processing orders, invoicing, and generating customer recommendations. Additionally, the team will design a database structure, create tables, and write, test, and deploy PL/SQL stored procedures to execute various operations and generate reports. This group project is organized into individual tasks assigned to each team member, who will work independently on their assigned components. The project will be completed incrementally, with both individual and group deliverables, ensuring collaboration on integrated project components.
